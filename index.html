			<h3>Challenges for Running App</h3>

				How can we boost the users' engagement and selling branded challenges. How can we help users to surpass
				themselves by competing with others.

					<b>role</b> I was the responsible designer for social engagement in the Runtastic App. This project
					not only augmented the app's social aspects but also aligned closely with business
					objectives, demonstrating the impact of my role from conception to launch.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> How to create users engagement?
					Engagement comes from users wanting to accept a real challenge with social interactivity.
					And a real challenge needs to match the individual balanced level of difficulty and feasibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> It was simply not possibel to ask users what they needed to be properly engaged by a
					challenge. So we needed to implement fast and learn from the feedback of active users.
					We started with a deep competitor analysis and a short design sprint to get a rough idea what we
					wanted.
					As soon as we had the basics we started with rounds of surveys and user interviews to get an idea of
					what we needed to do to increase the desire for deeper participation in our challenges.

			<h3>Photobook configurator</h3>
			<small>for Kartenmacherei</small>
			<p>
				The general briefing was to improve conversion and usability of the configurator.
				We conducted surveys and user interviews to identify the pain points and obstacles. Based on the
				outcome we conducted multiple projects (besides several smaller ones):
				A dedicated desktop experience, a more accessible navigation strucure, refining the design system
				for a more consistent experience and more direct editing.

					<br>
					<b>role</b> I worked for 9 month freelance as the responsible product designer with the team that
					developes the fotobook configurator.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> Designing a real application (like a configurator) is completely different from
					choosing from well established patterns for a "normal" web application.
					An application with a lot of dynamic states and complexity - not easy to cover all edge cases even
					in small interaction. <br>
					Once I needed to implement a Figma plugin to import and export the huge set of colors (coming from
					the printing departement).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> Based on the outcome of user interviews and competitor analysis' I built prototypes
					and designs/wireframes which I showed to the team in a weekly design updates meeting.
					Based on the feedback I refined the approaches and showed them also to users. I always try to reach
					a user-centric design process.

			<h3>Unify Experience of seperate compliance products</h3>
			<small>for Business Keeper (now EQS)</small>

			<p>
				Business Keeper was a hidden champion in building tools for compliance departements in big organisations. 
				The main product is an anonymous whistleblowing tool to face corruption, fraud and other problems.
				When I joined the company in 2019 the goal was to build a unified experience for a bunch very independent applications.

				<p>
					<br>
					<b>role</b> My role as the lead designer was to establish basic design working methods and a design system. 
					I also redesigned the applications and needed to align the products with multiple dev teams.
					Later we hired another junior designer and together we developed the design system for new applications like a central dashboard as an integral part of the unified compliance system.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> Multiple products with a different tech stack and a company that was not prepared to work with design was a huge challenge and I learned a lot. 
					I needed to integrate desing in all the existing processes.
					Also guiding a junior designer was new to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> In the beginning I needed to find a visual language that could represent the company. 
					So I tried to redesign a few screens of each application in different approaches and showed them to stakeholders.
					After multiple feedback loops, I showed the results to the whole company - and used the platform to introduce myself and the working method of design.
					With the idea of the design language I started to create the design systems - I now had atoms like colors and fonts and some rough ideas of some components.
					I also started to redesign on of the applications in detail.
					While doing so, I build up the design system - everytime I needed an interaction component i hadn't defined yet, I did so in together with the developers. 
					At the end I had a redesigned application consisting out of components and a pretty decent collection of components.

			<h3>Dreaming about a real digital photography experience</h3>
			<small>sideproject</small>
			<p>
				As a passionate photographer I love my camera but I always wonder why the digital experience is so not digital. 
				And that seems to be valid for basically all cameras on the market. 
				All cameras try to implement bad postproduction features instead of focussing on the process of taking pictures and then having a smooth handover to more suitable devices.
				So I started to note down all the things that I would expect from a camera that really integrates with our digital world.

					<b>role</b> Every single one from the big boss to the coffee cooking intern.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> Staying sane with all the posibilites and identifying the minimal set of features that makes it a dream camera. 
					Keeping the fun in taking photos :)
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> From a loose collection of ideas I derived various scenarios and user flows and a rough information architecture.
					Then I built wireframes for the required screens.
					I collected a <a href="https://www.pinterest.de/alterengo/kamera/" target="_blank">mood board for the hardware design on Pinterest</a> and extracted the design language for the app's interface from it.
					Currently I translate the wireframes into designs and a clickdummy.
