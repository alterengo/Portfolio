		<div class="case" id="runtastic_challenges">
			<h3>Runtastic: boost engagement with challenges</h3>
			<p>
				As the responsible product designer on the social features of the Runtastic app (now Adidas Running), my
				primary goal was to introduce engaging, interactive challenges that balanced difficulty with social
				interactivity.
				This involved conducting a comprehensive competitor analysis, organizing design sprints with the
				interdisciplinary scrum team, and maintaining a continuous feedback loop with users and the internal
				stakeholders.
				The initial focus on social challenges facilitated rapid deployment and user feedback, allowing for
				iterative improvements.
				This project not only augmented the app‚Äôs social aspects but also aligned closely with business
				objectives, demonstrating the impact of my role from conception to launch.

			<h3>Kartenmacherei: enhancing the fotobook configurtor</h3>
			<p>
				As a freelance product designer I spearheaded the redesign of the text customization feature,
				introducing the ability for font sizes to adapt dynamically to text length while maintaining
				readability.
				My technical expertise was showcased in developing a custom Figma plugin for importing and exporting
				data from the existing implementation.
				This was complemented by my active role in collaborative design and prototyping, where I contributed
				innovative solutions.
				My efforts significantly improved the configurator's flexibility and user-friendliness, balancing the
				needs of both mobile and desktop users.

			<h3>Business Keeper: transforming seperate applications into a unified experience</h3>
			<p>
				As the lead designer at Business Keeper (now EQS) hired in 2019, I led a transformative redesign of
				their compliance tool suite to address customer concerns about usability and appearance.
				I conducted a thorough analysis of all applications, identifying key interaction and navigation
				patterns. From this, I created a unified design system, defining basic components, a grid system, and
				consistent
				navigation behaviors. For an integrated experience and a seamless application transition we worked on a
				centralized dashboard application.
				Despite technical differences across products, I ensured the gradual implementation of this design
				system - collaborating closely with the development teams.
				My role extended to mentoring a junior designer, collectively enhancing internal tools and regularly
				updating our design approach.

		<h2>üë®üèª‚Äçüåæ how I work</h2>
		<!-- Description of Work Methodology -->
		<img src="images/my_process.png" alt="Screenshot">
		<p>
			<br>
			In my work I always try to focus on the outcome. At the end the product is what counts and the process is
			only a vehicle to produce a suitable, beautiful and also feasible solution for users.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless I try to implement a design thinking/user-centered/double diamond/or how ever you want to call
			it design process:
		</p>
		<p>
			First I focus on getting as much context as possible to understand the users and being able to identify
			their actual problem. I often times experienced that the final product does not solve the users‚Äô problem
			because there was not enough eye on what it actually is.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second step is to iterate on a solution that is a nice and usable match. With every iteration of
			ideation, prototyping and testing the solution will be better until a point where every stakeholder (this
			includes by all means the dev-team) is happy with it
