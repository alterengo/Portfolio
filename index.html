			<h3>fotobook configurator for Kartenmacherei</h3>
			<p>
				I worked freelance with the team of Kartenmacherei to improve their next gen fotobook configurator. We
				did several user interviews to identify how users use the configurator and what problems they have while
				doing so.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main issues we identified and wanted to tackle: The onboarding experience and the recognition of the
				user interface.
				The direct WYSISWYG editing of the content.
				We also figured out that the majority of the people doing the majority of the hours of work in
				configuring a fotobook on a desktop screen. So the last and very important goal was to craft a nice
				desktop experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides a lot of small improvements we worked on a dedicated desktop experience and the
				inline text editing with font styling.</li>

			<h3>aligning the Business Keeper compliance platform</h3>
			<p>
				Business Keeper is a multiple completely seperated products for compliance departements at bigger
				organisations. The main product is a secure whistleblowing interface, a management tool for the reports and cases and a
				tool to investigate and track the trustworthiness of business partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>goal</b> integrate the seperate products into a platform experience to support compliance
				departements in their overall process.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>projects</b> to build a platform consisting of multiple products and give the user a seemless
				user experience we had to conduct several projects:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>/ create a design system that contains identity and at the same time fits to the system experience
				</li>
				<li>/ create a central hub application that gives users an overview of urgent tasks and needfull overall
					statistics</li>
				<li>/ build an easy-to-use configurator and a checkout so that users are able to customize the
					products towards their needs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>challenges for Adidas Running</h3>
			<p>
				is a main feature for the Adidas Running App (former Runtastic). <br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Together with an interdisciplinary team we created an elementary feature based on a
				design sprint.
				From there we developed it depending on the feedback we got from the users.
				We built several prototypes and tested them with real users to evolve it user centered.

		<h2>👨🏻‍🌾 how I work</h2>
		<!-- Description of Work Methodology -->
		<img src="images/my_process.png" alt="Screenshot">
		<p>
			In my work I always try to focus on the outcome. At the end the product is what counts and the process is
			only a vehicle to produce a suitable, beautiful and also feasible solution for users.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless I try to implement a design thinking/user-centered/double diamond/or how ever you want to call
			it design process:
		</p>
		<p>
			First I focus on getting as much context as possible to understand the users and being able to identify
			their actual problem. I often times experienced that the final product does not solve the users’ problem
			because there was not enough eye on what it actually is.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second step is to iterate on a solution that is a nice and usable match. With every iteration of
			ideation, prototyping and testing the solution will be better until a point where every stakeholder (this
			includes by all means the dev-team) is happy with it
