					<b>role</b> I was the responsible designer for social engagement in the Runtastic App. This project
					not only augmented the app's social aspects but also aligned closely with business
					objectives, demonstrating the impact of my role from conception to launch.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> How to create users engagement?
					Engagement comes from users wanting to accept a real challenge with social interactivity.
					And a real challenge needs to match the individual balanced level of difficulty and feasibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> It was simply not possibel to ask users what they needed to be properly engaged by a
					challenge. So we needed to implement fast and learn from the feedback of active users.
					We started with a deep competitor analysis and a short design sprint to get a rough idea what we
					wanted.
					As soon as we had the basics we started with rounds of surveys and user interviews to get an idea of
					what we needed to do to increase the desire for deeper participation in our challenges.

			<h3>A fotobook configurator</h3>

			<p>
				The general briefing was to improve conversion and usability of the configurator.
				We conducted surveys and user interviews to identify the pain points and obstacles and based on the
				outcome we conducted multiple projects:
				A dedicated desktop experience, a more accessible navigation strucure, refining the design system
				for a more consistent experience and more direct manipulation (and several smaller ones).

					<b>role</b> I worked for 9 month freelance as the responsible product designer with the team that
					developes the fotobook configurator.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>challenge</b> Designing a real application (like a configurator) is completely different from
					choosing from well established patterns for a "normal" web application.
					An application with a lot of dynamic states and complexity - not easy to cover all edge cases even
					in small interaction. <br>
					Once I needed to implement a Figma plugin to import and export the huge set of colors (coming from
					the printing departement).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> Based on the outcome of user interviews and competitor analysis' I built prototypes
					and designs/wireframes which I showed to the team in a weekly design updates meeting.
					Based on the feedback I refined the approaches and showed them also to users. I always try to reach
					a user-centric design process.

					As the lead designer at Business Keeper (now EQS) hired in 2019, I led a transformative redesign of

					I conducted a thorough analysis of all applications, identifying key interaction and navigation
					patterns. From there, I created a unified design system, defining basic components, a grid system,
					and
					consistent navigation behaviors - the base for a complete redesign and alignment of all
					applications.
					To integrate the experience even more and create a seamless application transition we worked on a
					centralized dashboard application.
					Despite technical differences across products, I ensured the gradual implementation of this design
					system - collaborating closely with the development teams.
					My role extended to mentoring a junior designer, collectively enhancing internal tools and regularly
					updating our design approach.

		<h2>üë®üèª‚Äçüåæ how I work</h2>
		<p>
			I always have one eye on the goal and one on the future - that helps me to create products that solves
			problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my daily work I try to focus on the outcome. At the end the product is what counts and the process is
			only a vehicle to produce a suitable, beautiful and also feasible solution for users.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless I try to implement a design thinking/user-centered/double diamond/or how ever you want to call
			it design process:
		</p>
		<p>
			First I focus on getting as much context as possible to understand the users and being able to identify
			their actual problem. Second I iterate on a solution that is a beautiful and feasable match. With every
			iteration of
			ideation, prototyping and testing the solution will be better until a point where every stakeholder (this
			includes by all means the dev-team) is happy with it. <br>
