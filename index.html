				<h2>NextGen Fotobook Configurator for Kartenmacherei</h2>
				<p>
					I worked freelance with the team of Kartenmacherei to improve their next gen fotobook configurator. We did several user interviews to identify how users use the configurator and what problems they have while doing so.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>goal</b> The main issues we identified and wanted to tackle: 
					<ul>
						<li>// onboarding and recognition of the user interface</li>
						<li>// direct editing of content</li>
						<li>// experience for desktop usage was bad - we figured out that the majority of the people doing the majority of the hours of work in configuring a fotobook on a desktop screen</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>projects</b> Besides a lot of small improvements we worked on a dedicated desktop experience and the inline text editing with font styling.</li>

				<h2>Business Keeper Compliance Platform</h2>
				<p>
					At Business Keeper we had multiple completely seperated products for compliance departements at bigger organisations.
					The main product is a secure whistleblowing interface, a management tool for the reports and cases and a tool to investigate and track the trustworthiness of business partners.
	 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>goal</b> integrate the seperate products into a platform experience to support compliance departements in their overall process.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>projects</b> to build a platform consisting of multiple products and give the user a seemless
					user experience we had to conduct several projects:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>/ create a design system that contains identity and at the same time fits to the system experience</li>
					<li>/ create a central hub application that gives users an overview of urgent tasks and needfull overall statistics</li>
					<li>/ build an easy-to-use configurator and a checkout so that users are able to customize the
						products towards their needs.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Challenges for Adidas Running</h2>
				<p>
					is a main feature for the Adidas Running App (former Runtastic). <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>goal</b> strength
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> Together with an interdisciplinary team we created an elementary feature based on a
					design sprint.
					From there we developed it depending on the feedback we got from the users.
					We built several prototypes and tested them with real users to evolve it user centered.

				<h2>Runtastic Steps</h2>
				<p>
					is an advanced step counter app with training plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>goal</b> To design an app that works for less sporty people and helps them to enter the world of
					Runtastic apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> To generate a rough idea we started with a design sprint. I was the only
					product designer in an interdisciplinary scrum team.
					While working on the mvp and adding more and more features to it, I did several user tests.
					I prototyped ui animation mostly with Principle.

				<h2>Volkswagen</h2>
				<p>
					is a well-known car manufacturer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>goal</b> Building a car configurator for the web that makes the process of configuring a car
					understandable and easy to use.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>workflow</b> This was a huge project. We created a living styleguide to align within the design
					team and to collaborate with the developers.
					We worked in several scrum teams to cover the different aspects simultaneously. For an external user
					test we built an extremely high fidelity prototype in html/css.

					In my work I always try to focus on the outcome. At the end the product is what counts and the process is only a vehicle to produce a suitable, beautiful and also feasible solution for users.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless I try to implement a design thinking/user-centered/double diamond/or how ever you want to call it design process: 
				</p>
				<p>
					First I focus on getting as much context as possible to understand the users and being able to identify their actual problem. I often times experienced that the final product does not solve the users‚Äô problem because there was not enough eye on what it actually is.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second step is to iterate on a solution is a nice and usable match. With every iteration of ideation, prototyping and testing the solution will be better until a point where every stakeholder (this includes by all means the dev-team) is happy with it
